Project was created as part of [this](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx/) challenge from [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/).

The challenge consisted in create an application where you can add images (by setting a url and a tag for it) with its own API. 

Also Fulfill the user stories below:

- "I can see a list of photos in the masonry layout that I have added."
- "I can add a new photo to the list - the new photo should be on top of the list."
- "I can search for photos by label."
- "When I hover a photo, I can see a label and a delete button."
- "I can delete images."
- " When I delete an image, I can enter my password."

** The password to delete an image is: "1234" (without quotes)
